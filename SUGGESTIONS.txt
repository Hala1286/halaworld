1. Keep your project folders and files as clean as possible
  I mean remove unused files and folders
  
2. I suggest to organize your project as you would have to give that project to somebody else
  Create documentation or README file
  Create INSTALL file where you will put all things that you had to do before your project can run

 * Then if you have to do something in your project later you will be able to remember all details

3. It's not a rule but I like to keep project main dir as clean as possible
4. If you decide to keep library local (fontawesome) I would suggest to keep original folders and filenames
    Then later you will know which library and version you have in your project


5. If you want to have adaptive (changes it's sizes for different devices) website
   You have to use relative sizing approach width, height, margin, padding, etc. with percents "%"

6. In the beginning I suggest to use css paddings for last tag of the DOM tree. Or for the text elements
   For example: body > section > div > span.  So padding used at the span tag
    In other cases use margins and add more div's to replace padding by margin



NOW enough of suggestion lets talk about achievements:

[!] To fix your error with font awesome
    1. I have included all.css
    2. If you go here https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&q=house
        you can see that icon house is dim (a bit lighter then others ). It means that it is available from paid version
        look for dark icons in your case it will be fa-home
        RULE: to include icon you have to add style: fa fa-<icon_name>
               means for your home icon it has to be "fa fa-home"
        https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/examples/

[v] I do like your template, simple but gives main idea of who's site is this
[v] You did a good job with sections. 
    I would suggest to have 1 root div
   For ex: body > div > "rest of html like main and footer"
    Not all browsers have the same processing mechanism for the body tag
     means in some browsers your main and footer will be miss-aligned.
    That's why you have root div and then the rest will be relatively positioned

[v] I do like your idea to keep fontawesome in your project. 
    Any library can be embed (saved locally) or served from CDN (Content Delivery Network)[https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome]
      3.1  Big plus for having locally is speed
      3.2  Another advantage is you don't have to relay on other resource.

[v] Good trick with image (rounded corners)
   I will add align image in the center to the section
   This image a good example of how to replace css paddings by adding a child div tag

   also to make it work easy with css round image, image has to be square

Work TODO:
[] Add left section icons
[] Finish left section styling
[] Finish left section items :hover (styles when the mouse over item) animation styling
[] Since you're using sections and etc. replace div#listdiv with nav tag
[] Do the footer styling
