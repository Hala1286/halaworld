To run your project locally you have to have a web server

INSTALL:
  Simplest way is to install python
  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3101/

RUN HTTP SERVER  
 1. Then open File Explorer where your project index.html is located

 2. Type CMD in address bar, then run in 

 3. CMD: python3 -m http.server

This will start server listening some port, it will tell you, but normally it's 8000

Means after starting web server you can open your browser and type
http://localhost:8000

STOP HTTP SERVER
 press Ctrl+c OR Ctrl+z OR just close CMD
